Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a Laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
Well I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover
